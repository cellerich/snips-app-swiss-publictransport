## Idea

With this action code and the acompagniing Snips Assistant you should be able to ask some questions about the next connections from your home station or from a origin to a destination.

>the documentation is in english but the Snips intentions, actions and TTS output will be available in German only for the moment

## Questions you can ask

- when is the next train to Zurich
- at what time ist the next train connection to Zurich
- can you tell me the next available connection to Zurich
- when is the next train?
- what time the next train is leaving?
- tell me the next train connection?
- when is the next train from Bern to Zurich?
- what time does the next train from Bern leave towards Zurich?
- tell me the next train connection from Bern to Zurich!
